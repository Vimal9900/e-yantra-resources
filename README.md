#### Path Planning Algo (Basic idea)

Path planning is used for autonomous robots to find the shortest path in the given environment. Path planning requires a map of the environment, let it be line follow or to navigate from one
place to another. It is required to have a map of the environment and the robot to be aware of its
location with respect to the map. There are different ways to program the robot to make it follow the shortest path. It is up-to the
individual to decide which path planning algorithm is best suited for the given environment. You can refer the following links to learn various path planning algorithms:
